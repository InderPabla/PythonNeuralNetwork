# Python Neural Network

## Basic Self Driving Car 
- Basic concept of self driving car using Convolutional Neural Networks 
- CNN was trained using 500, 50x50 pixel images. 
- Each image was followed by a output of 2 neurons representing left and right turn

- It can be seen that by the 6th layer, the network has learnt to respond with high activation on edges , curves, and the car

## Advanced Self Driving Car 
- Convolutional neural network takes additional inputs of steering angle, current velocity and turn speed 
- Car must also learn to avoid obstacles as it drives on the track

- Layer has the highest activation when detecting obsticals infront of the car 
- This shows, by the 4th layers, neural network can identify a safe path to take if presented with obstacles
