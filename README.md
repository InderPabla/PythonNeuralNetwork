# Python Neural Network

## Self Driving Car 
- Basic concept of self driving car using Convolutional Neural Networks 
- CNN was trained used 500, 50x50 pixel images. 
- Each image was followed by a output of 2 neurons representing left and right turn

- It can be seen that by the 6th layer, the network has learnt to respond with high activation on edges , curves, and the car
